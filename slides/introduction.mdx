## Atomic Hypothesis

>If all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis, that **all things are made of atoms** - little particles that move around, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little **imagination and thinking** are applied.

:::note
We will explore the classical consequences of the atomic hypothesis using a simple model for how atoms interact.  
Familiarity with the following concepts is assumed:
- Basic calculus (minimizing/maximizing functions, Taylor series)
- Classical mechanics (Hamilton's equations)

:::note
By the end of this lecture, you will gain a better understanding of the following mathematical/physical concepts:
- Non-dimensionalizing physical models
- Deriving equations of motion from non-dimensional models
- Solving equations of motion analytically and numerically
