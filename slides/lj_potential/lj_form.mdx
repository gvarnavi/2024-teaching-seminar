## Form of the Lennard Jones Potential

- The Lennard-Jones potential &rarr; model for potential energy of two separated particles
- The model is simple:
  - particles attract each other when they are far apart
  - particles repel each other when they are very close
- All of the physics and its consequences derive from the shape of the potential:

- When the distance is small:
  - potential energy decreases with increasing distance
  - force is positive &rarr; particles repel
- When the distance is large:
  - potential energy increases with increasing distance
  - force is negative &rarr; particles attract
- We could construct many functions that behave like this
  - the Lennard-Jones potential is a simple choice
