## Form of the Lennard Jones Potential

- The Lennard-Jones potential &rarr; model for potential energy of two separated particles
- All of the physics and its consequences derive from the shape of the potential:

<LennardJonesForm />

- When the distance between the particles is small:
  - potential energy decreases with increasing distance
  - force is positive &rarr; particles repel
- When the distance between the particles is large:
  - potential energy increases with increasing distance
  - force is negative &rarr; particles attract
