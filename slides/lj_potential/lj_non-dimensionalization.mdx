## Non-Dimensional Expression

- The Lennard-Jones potential is given by a linear combination of two terms:
  - an attractive term that goes to zero as $-\frac{1}{r^6}$ as $r \to \infty$
  - a repulsive term that goes to infinity as $\frac{1}{r^12}$ as $r \to 0$

$$
U_{\mathrm{LJ}} = \frac{a}{r^{12}} - \frac{b}{r^6}
$$

- This form is useful for investigating material-specific behaviour

<LennardJonesNondimensional />

- To investigate the physics instead, we will define a general non-dimensional form by:
  - introducing a non-dimensional length $\rho = \frac{r}{r_{\mathrm{min}}}$
  - setting the potential energy minimum to a value of -1
- In order to achieve this in code, we solve for $a$ and $b$ using the conditions:
  - the potential is minimized at $r_{\mathrm{min}}=r/\rho$
  - the potential evaluated at $r_{\mathrm{min}}$ equals -1
